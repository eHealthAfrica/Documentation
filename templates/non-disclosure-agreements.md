# Data Analysis and Sharing Agreement 

This Data Analysis and Sharing Agreement (“Agreement”) dated as of the last date set forth below, is made by and between the Programme National de Lutte Contre la Trypanosomiase Humaine Africaine (“PNLTHA”) and eHealth Africa (collectively, the “Parties”) for the purpose of advancing research aimed at eliminating Human African Trypanosomiasis (“HAT”) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”).

## BACKGROUND
eHealth Africa is a U.S. registered international non-governmental organization based in Kano, Nigeria, working at national and local levels to improve health systems through data driven innovation solutions. eHealth Africa works through strong partnerships with civil society and government institutions. HAT is a vector-borne parasitic disease for which the DRC carries a large majority of the global case burden. To meet WHO elimination and eradication goals, eHealth Africa is partnering with PNLTHA, via a joint agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (“BMGF”), to develop applications supporting the work of mobile units and their coordination and evaluation. Sharing of data is critical for eHealth to analyse requirements to carry out these activities for the PNLTHA.
