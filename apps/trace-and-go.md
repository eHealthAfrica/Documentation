## Vision

### Problem statement

A huge problem in the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the traceability of people that have been admitted to health facilities. Unfortunately it is a very common case that health workers pick up infected people, admit them to a health facility and the person dies without the family knowing which facility the person was admitted to or where they are buried.
 
Partially as a result of this, distrust of the ETUs is high. 

Extended scope
 
Text messaging functionality will be expanded along two further cases:
* to provide similar simplified status updates to patients with conditions that are not Ebola
* to provide similar status updates to patients admitted to hospitals (i.e. expanding beyond the ETUs)

### Application

There appears to be a gap in the psychosocial support offered to families during a crisis like the Ebola Outbreak. 

The Trace and Go service provides a much needed support layer to families to help them build trust in the health system by notifying relatives of someone admitted for treatment via SMS about the  patientsâ€™ condition or location. 

Families receive a notification any time the patient's status or location changes, or at regular intervals, whichever is more regular. 

## Use Cases

| Role |	Description |	Personas |
|---|---|---|
| Case Investigator / Health Worker  | Case Investigators are responsible for monitoring patients. They are the only ones who interact with the online interface. Currently - most Case Investigators are employed by eHealth Africa. However, the rollout (coming soon) to other health services will mean this is no longer the case. Those health workers employed by eHealth Africa move around ETUS. Those not employed by eHealth Africa have a tendency to be more stationary. | Elizabeth (TODO)  |
| HF-Administrator | At each of the individual health facilities, there will be someone who is responsible for adding new Case Investigators, new facilities etc. This person is the administrator. | Bob (TODO) | 
| Super Administrator | Someone in-country needs to be able to have administrative permissions to create new facilities, view all data and change anything if something goes wrong. This person will need to be quite responsive (they could work for eHealth). | Eric (TODO) |
| Call centre worker | People in the call centres will need to be able to look up whether a person is in the TAG system if they get a phonecall from a relative of someone at a health facility asking where they are. | Jolly (TODO) |
