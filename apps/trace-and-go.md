## Vision

### Problem statement

A huge problem in the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the traceability of people that have been admitted to health facilities. Unfortunately it is a very common case that health workers pick up infected people, admit them to a health facility and the person dies without the family knowing which facility the person was admitted to or where they are buried.
 
Partially as a result of this, distrust of the ETUs is high. 

Extended scope
 
Text messaging functionality will be expanded along two further cases:
* to provide similar simplified status updates to patients with conditions that are not Ebola
* to provide similar status updates to patients admitted to hospitals (i.e. expanding beyond the ETUs)

### Application

There appears to be a gap in the psychosocial support offered to families during a crisis like the Ebola Outbreak. 

The Trace and Go service provides a much needed support layer to families to help them build trust in the health system by notifying relatives of someone admitted for treatment via SMS about the  patientsâ€™ condition or location. 

Families receive a notification any time the patient's status or location changes, or at regular intervals, whichever is more regular. 

## Use Cases

There are people who directly interact with the TAG system, and some, like the relatives of patients, who will just be beneficiaries of the system. 

| Role |	Description | Quantity |	Personas |
|---|---|---|---|
| Health Worker (Formerly Case Investigator) | This health worker may be a doctor, nurse. These health workers will be Ministry of Health workers in the future. Previously, a large number of eHealth employees were in this role, but this will be too costly to maintain in the future. | 100-1000 | Elizabeth (TODO)  |
| HF-Administrator | At each of the individual health facilities, there will be someone who is responsible for adding new health workers, new ward lists etc. This person is the administrator. | 1 per facility | Bob (TODO) | 
| Super Administrator | Someone in-country needs to be able to have administrative permissions to create new facilities, view all data and change anything if something goes wrong. This person will need to be quite responsive (they could work for eHealth). | Initially 1-2 in country, can add more if workflow support needed | Eric (TODO) |
| Call centre worker | People in the call centres will need to be able to look up whether a person is in the TAG system if they get a phonecall from a relative of someone at a health facility asking where they are OR if someone with low literacy levels rings and cannot interpret their text message. | However many are in the call centre | Jolly (TODO) |
