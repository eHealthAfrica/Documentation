## Vision

HAT mobile teams’ existing data collection and dissemination process is currently a bottleneck in screening and treatment efficiency, creates a requirement for extensive manual reporting which cuts down teams’ available field time, in its current paper form, is prohibitively difficult to analyze for management support or perform data quality checks on. 

During 20 days a month mobile teams check villages on their list travelling on one direction, leaving copies of new case forms on treatment centers on their way out of each village. On their way back to their coordination center, they pick up copies of treatment forms from these health facilities. Once they are back in the team office, they stay for another 10 days to reconcile the list of villages visited with the list of planned villages, and add their case investigation information to the PNLTHA database. The current process requires mobile teams to carry a huge amount of historical paper forms (registers) in addition to the equipment, such as solar panels and motorbike batteries, needed to complete the work in the conditions of the field. Furthermore only villages listed in the planning are visited, which leads to many small villages which are potentially endemic not being visited at all.

A new data collection storage and dissemination solution is required that can:
* Decrease the data entry and reporting burden on mobile teams
* Support follow-up and confirmation activity workflows 
* Provide insights to coordinating staff to inform mobile team deployments and coverage
* Heavily reduce the required paper forms in order to facilitate the transition to more lightweight mobile teams
* Improve the coverage of mobile teams by speeding up data recording activities
* Reduce the time needed to publish yearly plan through automatisation of data reconciliation


### Application

For the teams engaged in the surveillance and treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) HAT Sense is a solution formed by

* An offline-first mobile application 
For mobile teams to register population screened, outcome of clinical and parasitological diagnostic tests, treatment and followup.

* A set of importers and validations 
For input of historical HAT data into a normalised data warehouse.

* A dashboard 
For coordinators and supervisors to analyse and aggregate data, overview results, inspect data quality and oversee team performance.

## Use cases

National HAT program in DRC - surveillance and control activities of the HAT program in DRC are implemented by mobile teams which visit villages, do population screenings, identify patients for tests, and then refer positive individuals to treatment centers where they go on multi-year 6 monthly treatment schedules.
