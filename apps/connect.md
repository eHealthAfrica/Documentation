## Vision

Connect is an application designed for managers overseeing various activities in the public health system of Kano State, Nigeria. 

The vision is both: 
a) to allow greater oversight and visibility into what is happening at state, zone and LGA level within Kano State
b) to support problem-solving by supporting greater interconnection between health workers trying to act on problems e.g. by providing them with a directory of who to contact for which problem. 

### Application

There are currently two major components to the Kano Connect project: 

* The directory - A central location for: 
  * information on who holds which role at which facility, including phone numbers, name, position. 
  * GIS information - i.e. where specific facilities are located 
* RISS alerts (Routine Immunisations Supportive Supervisions). A set of specific performance indicators have been defined and data is collected on a monthly basis to work out which facilities are performing well and which need specific followup actions. 

Other integrations may be finished in the future, e.g. LoMIS integration and Device Management.
