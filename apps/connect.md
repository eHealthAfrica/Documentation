## Vision

Kano Connect is a 36-month initiative to build a sustainable primary health care communications and
mHealth service platform in Kano State, Nigeria.

It provides core components to help address key information challenges in routine immunization (RI) such as limited provider-to-provider communication, reliance on paper-based data collection, long lag between reporting and
response, and limited operational visibility.

### Application

There are currently two major components to the Kano Connect project:

* The directory - A central location for:
  * information on who holds which role at which facility, including phone numbers, name, position.
  * GIS information - i.e. where specific facilities are located
* RISS alerts (Routine Immunisations Supportive Supervisions). A set of specific performance indicators have been defined and data is collected on a monthly basis to work out which facilities are performing well and which need specific followup actions.

Other integrations may be finished in the future, e.g. LoMIS integration and Device Management.
