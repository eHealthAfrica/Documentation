eHealth Africa’s mission is to build stronger health systems through the design and implementation of data–driven solutions that respond to local needs and provide underserved communities with tools to lead healthier lives.

Our core values capture the story of what we believe in and what we strive for. eHealth’s core values are:

### Impact & quality

We work on solving big problems. We believe in the power of technology to make a transformational difference in health systems, and we know that when we do high–quality work, we have the opportunity to change lives in the communities we impact.

### Innovative problem solving

We maintain a worldview driven by possibilities, not limitations. We build smart systems that will sustain beyond our tenures. We challenge prevailing assumptions, respect the urgency of the environments we operate in, and take smart risks to search for the best solution.

### Passion

We care intensely about what we do, and about whom we do it with. We inspire others with our tenacity and commitment to our communities and each other.

### Honesty

We are honest with our communities, our partners, our donors, and ourselves. We communicate with candor, respect, and humility. We are quick to admit our own mistakes, and work to correct them with openness and expediency.
