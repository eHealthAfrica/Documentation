As an organization, we benefit greatly from our FOSS nature of our tech stack, which is why we try to contribute back.

Nonetheless, every repository we start *is private by default*. This is because of the sensitive nature of the data our apps handle, the fact that a lot of internal discussions happen on GitHub issues and how easy it is to commit keys or similar to disastrous effect.

To open–source a repository:

1. Get a go–ahead from the responsible PO/PM or Justin
2. Squash your commits to simplify review
3. Open a GitHub issue about it
4. Get two +1 on the issue from other developers who are required to look through the codebase and commit history for sensitive information that might prevent open–sourcing the repository

Point `1` is necessary if the repo contains a complete product. If you want to open source just a small library or a module providing abstract or isolated functionality, then a note in a Slack channel will be enough.

Regardless of the closed or open nature of a repository, we use the [Apache License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) for our codebases.

All of our open–source contributions can be found in [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/ehealthafrica?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+only%3Apublic+).
