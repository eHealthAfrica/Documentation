Our design principles are influenced by the [Principles for Digital Development](http://digitalprinciples.org) and our experience and convictions designing software.

### User-centred means field-first

Deep domain awareness based on extensive field experience is essential to building the right thing and helping it succeed. We build software based on sometimes decade-old experience of experts in the field: Respect it and draw from it. As designers, we are not the target audience.

### Be open

We use open–source technology. We design for interoperability. We collaborate in the open.

### Value what works

Reusing existing solutions over starting from scratch. Field-tested tools over unproven ideas. Lightweight solutions over complete reimagining. Reliable APIs over unproven standards.

### Work offline

We might build software with web tech, but we design and develop it for use in areas with almost hostile connectivity conditions. Offline capability, reliable sync and resilient data storage are core to our way of building apps.

### Speed

Our software is used on underpowered devices with slow connections, sometimes in emergency situations. Engineering for performance and designing for fast, reliable use under these circumstances is both a moral imperative and crucial to being a useful tool. The benchmark is not other software, but pen and paper.

### Privacy and security

We work with very sensitive data that we don’t own. Ensuring privacy and security can be a matter of life and death.

### Be pragmatic

Over-designing and over-engineering are very real temptations. Deliver a lean solution first as basis on which to iterate upon further and consider the opportunity costs of delivering one feature over all the others, or over improvements in performance. If you find yourself designing custom UI for a single project, consider whether it can be abstracted for reuse or replaced with existing UI components or conventions.

### A shortcut is not the easy way out

When being pragmatic, aim for simpler solutions that allow iteration towards the ideal solution, avoiding ones that hinder improvement or would require extensive refactoring. Cut the inessential, shun risky assumptions with undue impact, build from what’s known for sure. Avoid putting so much effort into prototypes that you grow afraid of throwing them away.

### Value consistency and context

Consistency is not about uniformity, it’s about being predictable to the user. Put context before global rules. To borrow from [George Orwell’s _Politics and the English Language_](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/), “Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous”.

    - Add something about avoiding religiously charged symbols, e.g. red cross for apps that might be used in Muslim countries
